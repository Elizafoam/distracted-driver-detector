# Distracted Driver Detection
Using computer vision to classify a driver's behavior and spot distracted drivers.

## State Farm Distracted Driver Detection

### Description
We've all been there: a light turns green and the car in front of you doesn't budge. Or, a previously unremarkable vehicle suddenly slows and starts swerving from side to side.

When you pass the offending driver, what do you expect to see? You certainly aren't surprised when you spot a driver who is texting, seemingly enraptured by social media, or in a lively hand-held conversation on their phone.

According to the CDC Motor Vehicle Safety Division, one in five car accidents is caused by a distracted driver. Sadly, this translates to 425,000 people injured and 3,000 people killed by distracted driving every year.

The objective is to use a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images to classify each driver's behavior. Are they driving attentively, wearing their seatbelt, or taking a selfie with their friends in the backseat?
